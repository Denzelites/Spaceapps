    <div class="introduction text-lg">
        <p >So let's bring this full circle and ask why? Why exoplanets, they exist… clearly; but why do we gotta look for them. Well, there's two main reasons:</p>
    </div>
        <div class="point">
        <h2 class="">1. Extra-terrestrial life</h2>
        <p>One of NASA’s main goals is to search for extra-terrestial life in space, and seeing that we've exhaustively searched our own solar system and found nothing, the next logical conclusion is to search further, to look deep into the vast emptiness of space to find out the answer to the age old question: ARE WE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE? One strategy NASA frequently employs in the search for ET life is to search in “habitable zones” these are zones that are just the right distance from their star and have just the right temperature to allow water to form.</p>
        
        
    </div>
    <div class="point">
        <h2 >2. To find another home for humans</h2>
        <p>Now don't get me wrong Earth is cool you know, it's an amazing place. But eventually, we'll run out of resources to sustain human life on Earth, then at that point we'll have to look into the skies to find a new home for humans in order to continue our species. These new planets might have the added benefit of having less natural disasters, having unique resources or even precious metals in abundance e.t.c. But also splitting the human population can also mean that we won't have to worry about food shortage or water inadequacy, heck crime rates might even drop by a phenomenal amount given that we'll now have “enough to go round”.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="note bg-blue-200 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-2 text-blue-600">
            <p>These and many other reasons are why we look into the skies for answers, hopefully the day we find alien life might not be too far away from us. Till then… keep <b>ex-</b>ploring</p>
