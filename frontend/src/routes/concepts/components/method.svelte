        <p>Now the thing with exoplanets is that they're so <b>small</b>, it kinda hard to see them directly in the night sky with a telescope (pretty much impossible with the naked eye). So scientists came up with really <b>cool</b> and <b>clever</b> ways to find exoplanets in the night sky, let's go over them:</p>

        <h2>1. Radial velocity:</h2>
        <p>To understand how this works you need to understand what the Doppler effect is. Doppler effect is usually used when studying sound but it can also be applied to light. Doppler effect basically just says that as the source of sound moves further away from the observer the pitch or the frequency becomes lower or as it moves closer to the observer the pitch or the frequency becomes higher (bear in mind that pitch and frequency do not mean the exact same thing although they are similar/related). The same thing applies to light, as the source of light moves further away from the observer there's something called a red shift. Red shift is kind of like the Doppler effect but for light, now how it works is that the farther away the light source is from the observer, the lower the frequency of the light and on the color spectrum red light actually has the lowest frequency so as the light source (star) moves further away from the observer(telescope) it's frequency decreases thereby making it appear more red causing the “red shift”. Now how do all these fit together, well planet and stars have gravity and it is the gravity of a star that causes a planet to orbit around it now the planet also has a gravitational pull on the star but it is to a lesser extent, but this actually causes the star to be pulled a little bit out of it orbit and this can result in a red shift because as the star goes round and round in a circular or elliptical orbit it moves further and closer away from us observers causing a red shift which is measurable and which can be used to determine the extent of the gravitational pull of the planet on the star which can then be used to find the mass of the planet.</p>

        <h2>2. Transit</h2>
        <p>Now don't get me wrong Earth is cool you know, it's an amazing place. But eventually, we'll run out of resources to sustain human life on Earth, then at that point we'll have to look into the skies to find a new home for humans in order to continue our species. These new planets might have the added benefit of having less natural disasters, having unique resources or even precious metals in abundance e.t.c. But also splitting the human population can also mean that we won't have to worry about food shortage or water inadequacy, heck crime rates might even drop by a phenomenal amount given that we'll now have “enough to go round”.we're quite familiar with the solar eclipse that's when the Moon comes in between the sun and the earth and blocks light from the Sun getting to the Earth. Transits… are somewhat like that. The way transits work is… when a planet passes directly in front of a star and it is in between the star and the observer it causes a small but noticeable and measurable dip in the brightness of the star. This dip can then be measured relative to the normal brightness of the star to figure out how big the planet is i.e it's volume, using this along with the mass of the planet obtained from the radial velocity method, we can find the density of the planet thereby giving us an idea of the properties of the planet, e.g terrain and atmosphere. It is worth noting that the transit method can also be used to find out how far a planet is from the star it is orbiting by looking at how long it takes for the planet to go across the star or how long the “dip” in the star’s brightness is. Planets that are further away will cause a dip that last longer and vice-versa. Finally we can also get some idea about the composition and temperature of an exoplanet’s atmosphere, this is done by analyzing the color of light that passes through the planet from the star. This method has helped in finding the most planets and it will continue to be of great use in the years to come.

        <h2>3. Direct imaging:</h2>
        <p>This basically means taking pictures, however astronomers have found a way to remove the overwhelming glare associated with taking pictures of exoplanets orbiting stars(since the stars are much brighter than the planets). The way direct imaging works is almost like using sunglasses...you know, when you're looking directly at a bright light source. Imagine an airplane is passing just directly under the sun and you're trying to look at it. Well if you're wearing sunglasses you can actually look at it because sunglasses help to reduce the glare from the sun. Another way is by using your hands. You know you can also use your hands to block some of the light from the sun, so you can see the plane more clearly. Astronomers employ two processes that are quite similar to the above mentioned examples, one is the use of “coronagraphs” which are kinda like sun shades for telescopes, they are fitted inside telescopes and they reduce the intensity of the light coming through. The other is a “star shade” which works kinda like the second example, it's a gigantic device that is positioned externally in front of a space telescope and can help to block some light before reaching the telescope.</p>

        <h2>4. Gravitational microlensing:</h2>
        <p>Among his many insights, Albert Einstein rethought the concept of gravity, defining it less as a mysterious attraction between objects and more as a geometric property of spacetime. In other words, big objects warp the fabric of space. This effect causes light to distort and change direction when affected by the gravity of a massive object, like a star or a planet. So gravitational microlensing works like this, a big bright star lets out light, then the exoplanet and its star sits between the big star and the observer(which is us) and then the gravity of the exoplanet and its star focuses some of the light from the big star onto us(kinda like a lens), this causes the light being seen from the exoplanet and its star to be a bit brighter than usual and this increase in brightness can be measured and can be used to determine how much the light is being focused and how much gravity is used to focus the light. This can give us an idea of how heavy the planet is(it's mass). Sometimes, free-floating planets in space, ones that don't orbit a star, will cause quick microlensing events that astronomers will record. These events give us an idea of how common these so-called 'rogue' planets are in the galaxy. It is also worth noting that astronomers can't predict when or where these “lensing” events will happen. So they have to watch large parts of the sky over a long period of time.</p>

        <h2>5. Astrometry</h2>
        <p>First, go and read the Radial Velocity text for an explanation of how planets cause their stars to wobble around in space. We'll wait! Okay, back? Good. Doppler shifts aren't the only way astronomers can find stars that are wobbling due to the gravity of their planets. The wobble can also be visible as changes in the star's apparent position in the sky. In other words, scientists can actually detect the star's position wiggling around in space. Astrometry, as this method is called, is still amazingly hard to do. Stars wobble such a minute distance that it's very difficult to accurately detect the wobble from planets, especially small ones the size of Earth. In order to track the movement of these stars, scientists take a series of images of a star and some of the other stars that are near it in the sky. In each picture, they compare the distances between these reference stars and the star they're checking for exoplanets. If the target star has moved in relation to the other stars, astronomers can analyze that movement for signs of exoplanets. Astrometry requires extremely precise optics, and is especially hard to do from the Earth's surface because our atmosphere distorts and bends light.</p>

        <p>All these methods each have their strengths and weaknesses, some are harder to use than others, but scientists and astronomers are constantly coming up with innovative solutions to these challenges and new planets are being discovered everyday.</p>
