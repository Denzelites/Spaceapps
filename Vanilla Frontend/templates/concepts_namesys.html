        <h1>Exoplanet Naming Systems</h1>
        <p>Exoplanets, planets outside our solar system, are given names based on structured naming conventions. Two main naming systems are used:</p>

        <h2>1. IAU Designations</h2>
        <p>The <strong>International Astronomical Union (IAU)</strong> assigns names to exoplanets using the name of the star, followed by a lowercase letter. The first exoplanet discovered around a star gets the letter “b,” and subsequent discoveries are labeled with letters in the order of discovery (c, d, etc.).</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> 51 Pegasi b is the first planet discovered around the star 51 Pegasi.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Catalog Designations</h2>
        <p>Many exoplanets are discovered through large surveys, so their names often include catalog numbers that indicate the mission or observatory that found them.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Common Catalogs:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kepler Mission:</strong> Exoplanets discovered by the Kepler Space Telescope are named with the prefix "Kepler-" and a number for the star system, followed by a lowercase letter (e.g., Kepler-22b).</li>
                <li><strong>WISE:</strong> The WISE mission follows a similar format (e.g., WISE 0855−0714b).</li>
                <li><strong>OGLE:</strong> The OGLE project uses designations for planets discovered via gravitational lensing (e.g., OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>3. Alternative Naming Systems</h2>
        <p>Occasionally, exoplanets are named through public contests or given culturally significant names.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> 51 Pegasi b was named <strong>Dimidium</strong> after a public voting campaign.</p>
