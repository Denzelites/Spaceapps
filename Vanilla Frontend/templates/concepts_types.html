  <h1>Brief Overview</h1>
  <p>Exoplanet Variety: From Gas Giants to Rocky Worlds Exoplanets come in a vast array of sizes, from massive gas giants to smaller rocky planets. These planets can orbit their stars closely, far away, or even two stars at once. Some are frozen in icy darkness, while others are scorching hot. Here’s a breakdown of the main types of exoplanets:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Gas Giants: These are planets as large as Jupiter or Saturn, or even larger. Some, like “Hot Jupiters,” are located so close to their stars that their temperatures soar to thousands of degrees.</li>
      <li> Super-Earths: These planets are more massive than Earth but less so than Neptune. Some are rocky, and others may have atmospheres or oceans, making them intriguing candidates for further study.</li>
      <li> Terrestrials: Earth-sized or smaller, these rocky worlds might have surfaces composed of rock, silicate, water, or carbon. Some may even harbor signs of habitability, such as atmospheres or oceans.</li>
      <li> Neptunians: Similar in size to Neptune or Uranus, these planets have atmospheres dominated by hydrogen and helium and likely rocky cores. Some smaller varieties, called mini-Neptunes, don’t exist in our solar system but are common in other systems.</li>
